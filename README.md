## Lehigh-Lafayette Rivalry Timeline
The timeline below depicts some of the most iconic moments in the Lehigh-Lafayette Rivalry, from the beginning in 1882 through the present day. The Lehigh-Lafayette Rivalry was uninterrupted for 124 years straight, but was put on pause for the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The 156th Rivalry game was eventually played on April 10, 2021, and will hopefully continue for another 124 uninterrupted years.

## Timeline of the Patriot League 
For my timeline project I chose to focus on the history of the Patriot League. The Patriot League is a Division I collegiate athletic conference that began in 1986 with six charter members, Holy Cross, Lehigh, Bucknell, Colgate, Lafayette and Davidson. At it's start, however, the Patriot League was called the Colonial League. Davidson left the Colonial League two years later in 1988 and is now in the Atlantic 10 conference. The Colonial League officially changed its name to the Patriot League in 1990. In 1991, the Patriot League became an all-sport conference. By the end of the 1991 academic year, the Patriot League had eight members: Holy Cross, Lehigh, Bucknell, Colgate, Lafayette, Fordham, United States Military Academy (Army), United States Naval Academy (Navy). Fordham left the Patriot League four years later in 1995, but remained as an associate member for football. In 2001, American University joined the Patriot League, and Georgetown joined as an associate member for football. In 2013, Boston University and Loyola University Maryland joined the Patriot League.
