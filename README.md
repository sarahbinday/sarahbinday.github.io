# Timelines


## Lehigh-Lafayette Rivalry Timeline
The timeline below depicts some of the most iconic moments in the Lehigh-Lafayette Rivalry, from the beginning in 1882 through the present day. The Lehigh-Lafayette Rivalry was uninterrupted for 124 years straight, but was put on pause for the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The 156th Rivalry game was eventually played on April 10, 2021, and will hopefully continue for another 124 uninterrupted years.

## Timeline of the Patriot League 
For my timeline project I chose to focus on the history of the Patriot League. The Patriot League is a Division I collegiate athletic conference that began in 1986 with six charter members, Holy Cross, Lehigh, Bucknell, Colgate, Lafayette and Davidson. At it's start, however, the Patriot League was called the Colonial League. Davidson left the Colonial League two years later in 1988 and is now in the Atlantic 10 conference. The Colonial League officially changed its name to the Patriot League in 1990. In 1991, the Patriot League became an all-sport conference. By the end of the 1991 academic year, the Patriot League had eight members: Holy Cross, Lehigh, Bucknell, Colgate, Lafayette, Fordham, United States Military Academy (Army), United States Naval Academy (Navy). Fordham left the Patriot League four years later in 1995, but remained as an associate member for football. In 2001, American University joined the Patriot League, and Georgetown joined as an associate member for football. In 2013, Boston University and Loyola University Maryland joined the Patriot League.

## Social Media Platform Usage by Year
Below is a chart made using Chartbuilder representing data collected by Business of Apps following the usage of [Instagram](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/instagram-statistics/), [Snapchat](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/snapchat-statistics/) and [Facebook](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/facebook-statistics/) from 2014 to 2021. This chart is a visual representation of the data. On the X-axis of this chart are the years these platforms have been operating, while on the Y-axis are the annual platforms users, represented in millions. This chart shows that Facebook started with the greatest amount of users and has steadily been increasing each year, while Instagram and Snapchat take second and third place. From this data, one can also see that Facebook and Instagram have had steady growth, while Snapchat hasn't had the same performance.

## Changes in Percentage of Enrollment in Lehigh University's 3 Colleges

This chart depicts the changes in enrollment percentages between Lehigh University's 3 colleges. While the data changes each year, the College of Arts and Sciences consistently has the highest level of enrollment, followed by the College of Engineering, followed by the College of Business.

## Self-Reported Life Satisfaction & GDP Per Capita 
Below is a chart made using Chartbuilder representing data collected by [World Bank](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction) regarding both the GDP Per Capita (keeping constant 2011 international dollars) in addition to the Self-Reported Life Satisfaction in Cantril Ladder. These findings show that there is a correlation pattern between GDP Per Capita increases and Self-Reported Life Satisfaction increases.

## MLB Batting Average on Balls in Play and Plate Appearances
Below is a scatter plot made using Chartbuilder representing data collected by the [MLB](https://www.mlb.com/mets/stats/team) regarding the batting average on balls in play and plate appearances. As one can generally see from this scatter plot, with more plate appearances, MLB teams are more likely to have a higher batting average on balls in play.  To create this scatter plot, I found the MLB statistical data for each team's number of plate appearances in the 2022 season, in addition to each team's batting average on balls in play. The batting average on balls in play is a measure of a player's batting but while removing outcomes unrelated to the opposing defense, such as homeruns or strikeouts. Being that there are 30 teams in this dataset, and data in both categories for each team, I was able to create this scatter plot.

# Tableau


## Lehigh Party Location Survey
The visualizations below were created using Tableau and [data collected in 2016](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M3fvI1f7l4QP_zvlo5YA405N-6oZXp8SA1btxvsUyeI/edit) by prior Journalism 25, Data Journalism, students. The data collected polled Lehigh University students regarding their class year and campus affiliated groups and their party preferences, such as location, how they get to parties, which party locations they prefer and which parties they're most likely to attend. In the data below, one can see that female students tend to prefer off-campus parties while male students tend to prefer fraternity house parties. Additionally, students involved in Greek fraternities and sororities tend to prefer fraternity house parties while varsity athletes tend to prefer off-campus parties.

## Lehigh University Student Voting Habits 
The story compiled of three data visualizations below were created using Tableau and [2022 Lehigh University student voting habits data](https://lehigh.co1.qualtrics.com/responses/#/surveys/SV_57FYm52lbjs9GSy) collected by myself, Sarah Binday, Isabella Insigo and Page Hewitt. This data was collected through a survey on Lehigh Qualtrics and was distributed through different channels to reach a diverse group of Lehigh students. The motivation behind these visualizations was to create an interactive data story with Tableau to depict Lehigh University students' voting habits and political affiliations. The first data visualization in the story illustrates Lehigh University students' voting/registration status in the 2020 elections. Within the visualization, one can distinguish between students' political party alignment and their college enrollment within the University. The second data visualization in the story illustrates Lehigh University students' voting/registration status in the upcoming 2022 elections. While the data filters are the same as the visualization prior, this allows viewers to see the differences in voting behavior/political party registration from 2020 to 2022. The third data visualization in the story is a collection of three maps that separate Lehigh University students by political party alignment and home states with regard to students' state election registration status, such as being registered in their home state as opposed to being registered locally in Pennsylvania.
